## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- Mostly vanilla CSS
- Tiny bit o' Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a good exercise for me because it's been awhile since I've worked with CSS. It was a nice, easy reintroduction to how CSS and HTML work together.

### Continued development

I'm still pretty rusty with CSS so I'm definitely looking forward to some feedback on how I can improve this project. I think I'd also like to start learning some sort of CSS programming language like Sass or Less, but I'm unsure which at this point. Also to work more on responsive design, as that's something I was never super confident in.
